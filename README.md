# when wor(l)ds collide

we are all cyborgs. we all have two lives; one physical, the other digital. 'when wor(l)ds collide' investigates contentions of the world of cyborg that takes issue with borders, disruptions of representation and creates noise. it has been developed as a fraught landscape, which explores material and significant opportunities for competing experimental language use that directly and interfere with the experience. what are the inherent contradictions, harmonies and conflicts that will arise from such an interaction? that is what we are bound to explore.

# what it (claims to) does

watches your face and classifies what expressions it perceives. it uses a camera and early ai stack to interpret facial patterns as categories: happy, sad, angry, surprised, fear, or neutral.

## what you need

you need python 3.8 or newer installed on your computer.

## how to set it up

open a terminal and type these commands:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r REQUIREMENTS.txt
```

## how to run it

make sure your camera is connected. then type:

```bash
python expression_classifier.py
```

the program will open a window showing your camera feed with a box around your face. it will print your emotions to the terminal.
